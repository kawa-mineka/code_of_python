I wish we could make games too. ～～～～～～! I can't but 2020 06/28
I saw Nekobi's Revolgear!!! and impulsively started making a game! The main character is so cute!!! 2020 06/28
I just realized... maybe we live in an era where you don't need a programmer to make games? Now? 2020 06/28
Bourbon's "Fruit Reward" jelly is so delicious that my body can't go back to other jelly anymore 2020 07/01
Creating a Graphic of my aircraft and conventional missiles 2020 07/09

python Switching from MS Gothic to Myrica because the IDLE editor font is hard to read 2020 07/12
I buy an introductory book, but don't read it. 2020 07/13
I succeeded in moving my machine (but it only moves forward automatically) 2020 07/17
I can move my plane up, down, left, and right with the keyboard (but if it goes out of the screen, it doesn't come back) 2020 07/18
It takes me an hour to realize that I typed pyxel,text(5, 4, s, 1) when I should have written pyxel.text(5, 4, s, 1) 2020 07/19
Able to move my ship only within the screen, implemented a score display, and for some reason added a time bonus of 1 point for every 1 second (mysterious spec) 2020 07/19
Adjust the speed of movement to 3 different levels! Awesome 2020 07/19
Successfully launched missiles! But the movement of my plane is faster than the missile! 2020 07/19
Implemented description of background stars streaming out into space 2020 07/19

Implemented 8-directional bullets for enemies → for some reason, they seem to move very slowly 2020 08/02
Aimed bullets are implemented → Enemy bullets are still extremely slow 2020 08/02
When enemy bullets disappeared from the screen, the coordinate data of the bullets should be deleted from the list and looped back to the processing of the next bullet, but it suddenly broke and went to the processing of the next movement of the ship and the background scrolling. 08/02
I fully understood the difference between continue and break in a for loop! (maybe) 2020 08/02
Suffering from an error when deling a list element in a for statement loop because the number of elements in the list is off 2020 08/08
Knowing that accessing from the back of the list in a for loop and then deleting from the back of the list with a del instruction will not cause an index error because the index of the element in the direction the for loop is going won't be out of sync! 2020 08/08
for i in reversed(range(len(v))): del v[i] Know the reversed instruction! Awesome! 2020 08/08
Implemented a hit detection between ship and enemy, and between ship and enemy bullets, but only displays game over if the shield becomes 0 2020 08/08

Struggled to implement rolling claw (claw) 2020 09/06
Claw (hard work) with process to make rolling claw rotate at equal intervals when added 2020 09/13
I added self.claw[i].degree = self.claw[i].degree % 360#Angle is the remainder divided by 360 (0~359) and it worked... I'm impressed... It took 15 days... 2020 09/13
Struggled to implement trace claw (claw) 2020 09/14

VIPER and ・・・・SNAKE... 2020 11/01
But ... they live on in our hearts 2020 11/01
I have a sweet idea to implement one stage from the beginning to the destruction of the boss by the end of this month... 2020 11/01
I don't know anything about background music... 2020 11/02
I upgraded to Pyxel 1.4.3 and now it doesn't crash at all because of sound ～～～～* 2020 11/02
Pyxel 1.4.3 version up to 1.4.3 and now it doesn't crash at all. 2020 11/02
Power-up items implemented 2020 11/07
How can I get a power up item when all the formation is defeated? It is easy to give out items when certain enemies are defeated... 2020 11/07
Enemies with power-up items and those without power-up items were the same color, but only those with power-up items are yellow 2020 11/08
Adjusted the number of power-up item bounces 2020 11/09
Struggled with sound effects when getting power-up items → Took about 2 days to get something satisfactory (I'm not good with sound...) 2020 11/09

Start implementation of triangle items 2020 11/19
Struggling with the implementation of the decision of whether or not my plane is located inside a triangle 2020 11/19
Inner product between 3 points? Hmm? Calculate the distance of each vertex of the triangle from the ship (by Pythagorean definition)? I don't understand 2020 11/21
Is the outer product of vectors really only for 3 dimensions? I'm even more confused 2020 11/21
I'm having trouble with a mysterious bug where I'm calling a function with an int and for some reason it returns a tuple return value, I don't know why, so I created an external variable and assigned the variable to it so that it returns without a return value 2020 11/22
Does the type change on a whim? python 2020 11/22
Triangle item is a compromise to determine the distance from the center... 2020 11/22

I was worried that it wouldn't work, but then I thought about it and realized that I had to move the file to the same folder as the pygame program or else I would get an error because I couldn't find the assets folder... I was worried for about 6 hours.
Implement Japanese text display function using Misaki font → Finish creating code conversion table and font image files 2021 04/25 → Start implementing display function

2021 05/09 Implemented the score ranking display from the main menu, and the page roll-up display with left and right input for each difficulty level.
I'm in a very umapiyo mood 2021 05/10
I'm stuck with a homebrew function for quick sorting scores... Should I create a new list and go with the built-in sort() function... hmmm... 2021 05/11
Implemented a simple bubble sort for sorting scores instead of quick sort after all... It's only 11 elements, so it's okay, even if it's slow 2021 05/13
Completed implementation of score ranking display 2021 05/14
The text display in the window class used to be done by creating a variable for each line and assigning it to each variable, but this could not be processed in a loop no matter how the for statement was used, so the text was expanded and displayed in a list. (I know, it's like "start from the beginning! I was able to reduce the number of lines by about 250, and it looks much better.
When a window goes out of the screen, it is clipped and erased. 2021 05/23
What the heck is a hoge? I was thinking about this all day today. 2021 05/23
I didn't understand it after all, so tomorrow I'll be thinking about "what the heck is fuga? I have a feeling this will probably be a car... 2021 05/23
Finally changed the file name of the main program to "code-of-python"! 2021 05/29
I squashed a bug that was causing an out-of-index error when I erased a window in the middle of a window that was trying to get the index value of the foremost window based on the ID of the active window, but the index value was out of sync! (It took me 2 weeks to reproduce this bug by messing up the pad...) If you think about it, when you kill an enemy, you get an error like "DEL and index does not exist! I made the same mistake... History repeats itself... 2021 05/29
Name Entry (Maybe it's not necessary? I'm wondering how to display the difficulty level... 2021 05/29
In the DEFFICULTY selection menu, the window now jumps away in various directions after selection. 2021 06/07
In the CONFIG screen, a new item for switching between full-screen and windowed startup is implemented -> I want to switch between full-screen and windowed display on the fly if possible (is it possible?), though it can only be switched by restarting the system. 2021 06/07
It is now possible to turn on/off the boss mode, hitbox display, and debug status display on the CONFIG screen. 2021 06/07
When exiting from the CONFIG screen, the system data is saved and the resources of the title screen are reloaded so that the system data can be reflected immediately. 2021 06/07
The closing process of each window is implemented. 2021 06/11
When adjusting a value with the left/right keys in the CONFIGir menu window, left/right arrows are displayed to indicate whether the current value is the maximum value or the minimum value? It is now possible to know whether the current value is the maximum, minimum, or middle value. 2021 06/13
The volume of the main BGM can be changed in CONFIG (I'm not sure about the SE one, so I'm not going to do it! I don't understand pyxel sound!) 2021 06/19
Graphic data related display in the window view, and animation is now possible. 2021 06/20
I think the phenomenon that the power capsule doesn't come out when an enemy is defeated sometimes is related to the hit detection between the claw shot and the enemy. → I think the indentation is wrong in the loop part of the claw shot and enemy hit judgment function, so the instruction that should be processed was not processed.
It seems that sometimes the power capsule does not appear when an enemy is defeated? Maybe it doesn't appear when you defeat an enemy (only formation group?) with a subweapon? I'm not getting a power capsule when I kill an enemy (only formation group?) with a subweapon? Maybe? → I think it's not the subweapon, but the claw shot and the enemy's hit detection function that's causing it! Really? ! 2021 06/20
Sound effects (SE) when moving the cursor in the window menu or pressing buttons are implemented. 2021 06/20
A year has passed since I started making a shooting game with an idea... I've only made 2 levels... No good!
Display of medal list and detailed comment of each medal (Slot attachment is not implemented yet) 2021 07/04
Added Japanese language display in the medal list description (also implemented recording in system data). 2021 07/05
Added the ability to jump over obstacles when moving the cursor in the medal list. 2021 07/09
In the medal list, the ok button for 3 characters horizontally is implemented and the rectangle type cursor is enlarged to fit the size of the button. 2021 07/11
The size of the code list of the main program exceeded 1MB and I can't push to github anymore... What should I do...? 2021 07/11
I'm thinking of splitting my program, but I don't know how to do it in python...! 2021 07/11
I want to separate constant definitions and class declarations from the main program list... 2021 07/11
I don't understand modules, libraries, frameworks, imports, etc...! 2021 07/11
Oh well... Let's go with one file as it is... 2021 07/11
Added an exit item from the main menu, so that the game can be exited, and the game exit by pressing the ESC key has been eliminated. 2021 07/11
Added a pause menu item, allowing users to return to the title from pause and exit the game. 2021 07/17
The game exit process is divided into "Exit from Title" and "Exit from Pause", and the title logo is not displayed when exiting from pause (the background is darkened and stars are played → the stars gradually slow down and stop) 2021 07/18
The medal equipment window is implemented (not yet implemented for medals with more slots...) 2021 08/05 → Medals with more slots are also supported. 2021 08/09
The medal equipment window is now automatically left-justified when an empty slot is found. 2021 08/06
Added information on medals obtained and medals equipped on each aircraft to save and load system data. 2021 08/07
Implemented the effect of medals that can obtain shot items in advance (the process of changing shot items into scoring items is not yet implemented) 2021 08/08 → Completed the implementation of the score star 2021 08/09
Scorestar instead of shot items when equipping medals that allow you to get shot items in advance 2021 08/08
Score star can be increased from 1x to 2x to 3x to 4x to 5x by taking score star without damage in a row (up to 5x for now) 2021 08/08
Implementation of L's Shield equipment medal (durability display is not yet available...) 2021 08/08/08
Implementation of STATUS menu: displaying cumulative game play time, number of times played, cumulative total score, and load-save from system data 2021 08/11
Implemented the selection of aircraft from the aircraft selection window as a provisional feature. Well, there is still only one aircraft, JUSTICE PYTHON. ・・・・・ 2021 08/11
Implemented to display the number of cleared stages, the number of loops, and the medal equipment at the time of clearing on the scoreboard (not yet save-loadable as system data...) 2021 08/12
I split constant definitions and class declarations as separate modules, from const import* and from define_class import*, but wildcards in import* are not recommended. And today I had a colonoscopy.... .orz
The scoreboard data is now loaded as system data before the game starts, and saved automatically each time. 2021 08/13
added saving the names for ranking scores as system data 2021 08/13
Import copy is introduced to copy the default list without changing the reference source. copy.deepcopy() can be used (It is hard to understand how the ID of the reference source is only copied...) 2021 08/14
Initialize score data by CONFIG→INITIALIZE→SCORE 2021 08/15
Initialize my name by CONFIG→INITIALIZE→NAME 2021 08/15
Bon vacation is about to end with almost nothing done: ・・・・・ 2021 08/15 AM 3:00
I didn't get anything done! 2021 08/15 AM 3:08
CONFIG→INITIALIZE→ALL to initialize all system data (development testtime continues to be recorded as an exception) 2021 08/15
Implemented medals that can be obtained by total score and total game play time 2021 08/15
Implemented a dialog window for obtaining medals that appears in the title menu, with wait_count in the window class data so that multiple dialogs are displayed in sequence 2021 08/15
I've made it so that you can get a medal when the number of consecutive score star chains you get exceeds a certain value. ・・・・ sometimes the max_score_star_chain record works and sometimes it doesn't. Is there something wrong with the formula? Or? I don't know... 2021 08/15
When you get a score star, if you look at score_star_magnification (magnification) and you meet the conditions to get a medal, you can create a flag called medal_get_flag and set it up and process it in the main menu...? 2021 08/15
I don't know, I don't know what I don't know... 2021 08/15
Fixed a bug in the calculation of the multiplier for consecutive score stars.
Fixed a bug that total play time and total score are added when replaying replays.
Fixed a bug that total play time and total score are added when replaying replays, maybe it worked 2021 08/27
Karen is so cute, the earth is in trouble 2021 08/27
Achievement dialog is now implemented.
For some reason I started playing Cookie Clicker again... Oh the beginning of my life of baking cookies ・・・・ 2021 09/03
Fixed a bug that the effect of the pre-shot medal equipped on the medal during replay is that the medal gets the pre-shot item, but instead of getting the score star, it gets the shot item instead, which greatly increases the power of the medal (I think it's working...) 2021 09/05
I changed my job to a painter, got into the steam version of Cookie Clicker, and got into Hololive, so I've been slacking on game creation... 2022 02/26
I noticed that pyxel has been updated to version 1.6.9, and the specification seems to have changed a lot, so I decided to modify the program list... 2022 02/26
It looks like pyxel.init(caption=) has been changed to pyxel.init(title=)? 2022 02/26
pyxel.tilemap(0).get(0,120) seems to have to be changed to pyxel.tilemap(0).get(0,120)? 2022 02/26
I got it to work with version 1.6.9...but...the explosion sound when enemies are destroyed sounds a little different.
Moved the list definitions that never change in the game, such as enemy appearance data, into the define_data.py file and created a class define_data, which can be imported as a separate file module. 2022 04/02

The White-Tailed Hymn is good....... 2022 04/02
Tinnitus in right ear is so bad that I can't hear anything... 2022 04/02
I can't adjust the stereo or anything.... .orz 2022 04/02
I can't commit to github anymore... I don't know what's going on... 2022 04/02
I prefer Kit Kat to GitHub ・・・・ 2022 04/02
Started to manage program list by splitting files code-of-python.py const.py define_class.py define_data.py define_ship_data.py define_stage_data.py func.py graph.py Split into 2022 04/04
All methods called from draw are now placed in the graph class 2022 04/04
The methods called from update are large, so we can use update_my update_enemy update_boss or something like that. Or should I go with something like update_object for the background object... hmmm... 2022 04/04
I made all the methods called from update into a separate file in a separate class and imported them. I can't understand the 15,000+ lines at a glance.
Started work on 3-sided VOLCANIC_BELT volcanic zone 2022 04/10
Implemented free scrolling of 3-sided VOLCANIC_BELT in 2 vertical screens, but the up/down visibility is poor and it is easy to hit obstacles, so I want to add some assortment to the up/down scrolling... but I don't know how to do it. 2022 04/16
Implemented multiple scrolling of VOLCANIC_BELT, although the background is still strange. 2022 04/17
Implemented raster scrolling on the lake surface of VOLCANIC_BELT! Yay! 2022 04/23
I committed to github and pushed the project, but I got an error. fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict. 2022 04/23
I think I managed to pull master -> (2) check status with git status -> (3) check this red area -> (4) add the red file and commit -> (5) check status with git status? 2022 04/23
I guess I should check it with git status - I see. 2022 04/23
2022 04/23 I implemented volcano eruption and lava flow animation, but it's not so good... 2022 04/25
Added animations to the induction lights of the gate bridge. 2022 04/28
After updating pyxel to 1.6.9, MOUNTAIN_REGION's descent to the ground causes a final 1-dot gap in the downward scroll →Event list [3000,EVENT_SCROLL,SCROLL_SPEED_CHANGE_VERTICAL,0,-0. 004] with [3000,EVENT_SCROLL,SCROLL_SPEED_CHANGE_VERTICAL,0,-0.0041] ok 2022 04/30
I discovered that clawshot had been creating and updating instances in the shot class all this time... I modified it to create instances in the claw_shot class, and it seems to have been working like this all this time... Surprise! I was surprised to find that the shot class and the claw_shot class were almost the same in terms of member variables. 2022 05/01
I changed the color from 0-15 to use the standard pyxel constant definitions. (pyxel.COLOR_BLACK or some such constant definition) 2022 05/01
I created a .gitignore file and wrote __pycache__ to prevent pyc files from being uploaded! Finally. 2022 05/01
Tentatively started to make the map for the second round of the third side. 2022 05/01
Color codes were specified directly by numbers, but now they are defined by constants in the pyxel standard. 2022 05/01
However! I typed pyxel.COLOR_GLAY and was troubled for about an hour, "Why is there an error? I was wondering for about an hour. The correct answer is pyxel.COLOR_GRAY, lol. 2022 05/01
Sen no nai wifu ga mune wo sasu! Aitai kara~~~ I think of you~~~ wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! 2022 05/01
The background BG rewrite animation was changed to rewrite only the BG on the screen judging from the camera position even in a stage with two vertical scrolling screens. 2022 05/01
Added a new enemy character "Roll Blitz", but it doesn't disappear when it appears on the screen, it moves to the far right. (A mess...) 2022 05/02
Implemented only the movement of the boss in the volcano area on the 3rd page, put the movement points on the map and moved it while considering the control points... 2022 05/03
Implemented the attack of the boss on the 3rd plane. The homing laser looks like a human soul and spirit after all...scary! Evil spirit extinguished! 2022 05/03
The name of the boss on the 3rd page was decided to be "Mud Crab". Like? 2022 05/03
I added a tilt variable to Mudcrabunger to make it seem to tilt when rolling, and shifted the booster's drawing position when it draws. 2022 05/04
Added up-down laser to Mudcrabunger. 2022 05/05
Separated functions to access system data into update_system class and managed them as separate files. 2022 05/07
I started to manage program files separately, but it was hard to understand what kind of files they are. So I created a readme.txt file in the source folder with the details of program files. 2022 05/05
