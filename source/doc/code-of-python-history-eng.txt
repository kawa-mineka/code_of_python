I wish we could make games too. ～～～～～～! I can't but 2020 06/28
I saw Nekobi's Revolgear!!! and impulsively started making a game! The main character is so cute!!! 2020 06/28
I just realized... maybe we live in an era where you don't need a programmer to make games? Now? 2020 06/28
Bourbon's "Fruit Reward" jelly is so delicious that my body can't go back to other jelly anymore 2020 07/01
Creating a Graphic of my aircraft and conventional missiles 2020 07/09

python Switching from MS Gothic to Myrica because the IDLE editor font is hard to read 2020 07/12
I buy an introductory book, but don't read it. 2020 07/13
I succeeded in moving my machine (but it only moves forward automatically) 2020 07/17
I can move my plane up, down, left, and right with the keyboard (but if it goes out of the screen, it doesn't come back) 2020 07/18
It takes me an hour to realize that I typed pyxel,text(5, 4, s, 1) when I should have written pyxel.text(5, 4, s, 1) 2020 07/19
Able to move my ship only within the screen, implemented a score display, and for some reason added a time bonus of 1 point for every 1 second (mysterious spec) 2020 07/19
Adjust the speed of movement to 3 different levels! Awesome 2020 07/19
Successfully launched missiles! But the movement of my plane is faster than the missile! 2020 07/19
Implemented description of background stars streaming out into space 2020 07/19

Implemented 8-directional bullets for enemies → for some reason, they seem to move very slowly 2020 08/02
Aimed bullets are implemented → Enemy bullets are still extremely slow 2020 08/02
When enemy bullets disappeared from the screen, the coordinate data of the bullets should be deleted from the list and looped back to the processing of the next bullet, but it suddenly broke and went to the processing of the next movement of the ship and the background scrolling. 08/02
I fully understood the difference between continue and break in a for loop! (maybe) 2020 08/02
Suffering from an error when deling a list element in a for statement loop because the number of elements in the list is off 2020 08/08
Knowing that accessing from the back of the list in a for loop and then deleting from the back of the list with a del instruction will not cause an index error because the index of the element in the direction the for loop is going won't be out of sync! 2020 08/08
for i in reversed(range(len(v))): del v[i] Know the reversed instruction! Awesome! 2020 08/08
Implemented a hit detection between ship and enemy, and between ship and enemy bullets, but only displays game over if the shield becomes 0 2020 08/08

Struggled to implement rolling claw (claw) 2020 09/06
Claw (hard work) with process to make rolling claw rotate at equal intervals when added 2020 09/13
I added self.claw[i].degree = self.claw[i].degree % 360#Angle is the remainder divided by 360 (0~359) and it worked... I'm impressed... It took 15 days... 2020 09/13
Struggled to implement trace claw (claw) 2020 09/14

VIPER and ・・・・SNAKE... 2020 11/01
But ... they live on in our hearts 2020 11/01
I have a sweet idea to implement one stage from the beginning to the destruction of the boss by the end of this month... 2020 11/01
I don't know anything about background music... 2020 11/02
I upgraded to Pyxel 1.4.3 and now it doesn't crash at all because of sound ～～～～* 2020 11/02
Pyxel 1.4.3 version up to 1.4.3 and now it doesn't crash at all. 2020 11/02
Power-up items implemented 2020 11/07
How can I get a power up item when all the formation is defeated? It is easy to give out items when certain enemies are defeated... 2020 11/07
Enemies with power-up items and those without power-up items were the same color, but only those with power-up items are yellow 2020 11/08
Adjusted the number of power-up item bounces 2020 11/09
Struggled with sound effects when getting power-up items → Took about 2 days to get something satisfactory (I'm not good with sound...) 2020 11/09

Start implementation of triangle items 2020 11/19
Struggling with the implementation of the decision of whether or not my plane is located inside a triangle 2020 11/19
Inner product between 3 points? Hmm? Calculate the distance of each vertex of the triangle from the ship (by Pythagorean definition)? I don't understand 2020 11/21
Is the outer product of vectors really only for 3 dimensions? I'm even more confused 2020 11/21
I'm having trouble with a mysterious bug where I'm calling a function with an int and for some reason it returns a tuple return value, I don't know why, so I created an external variable and assigned the variable to it so that it returns without a return value 2020 11/22
Does the type change on a whim? python 2020 11/22
Triangle item is a compromise to determine the distance from the center... 2020 11/22

I was worried that it wouldn't work, but then I thought about it and realized that I had to move the file to the same folder as the pygame program or else I would get an error because I couldn't find the assets folder... I was worried for about 6 hours.
Implement Japanese text display function using Misaki font → Finish creating code conversion table and font image files 2021 04/25 → Start implementing display function

2021 05/09 Implemented the score ranking display from the main menu, and the page roll-up display with left and right input for each difficulty level.
I'm in a very umapiyo mood 2021 05/10
I'm stuck with a homebrew function for quick sorting scores... Should I create a new list and go with the built-in sort() function... hmmm... 2021 05/11
Implemented a simple bubble sort for sorting scores instead of quick sort after all... It's only 11 elements, so it's okay, even if it's slow 2021 05/13
Completed implementation of score ranking display 2021 05/14
The text display in the window class used to be done by creating a variable for each line and assigning it to each variable, but this could not be processed in a loop no matter how the for statement was used, so the text was expanded and displayed in a list. (I know, it's like "start from the beginning! I was able to reduce the number of lines by about 250, and it looks much better.
When a window goes out of the screen, it is clipped and erased. 2021 05/23
What the heck is a hoge? I was thinking about this all day today. 2021 05/23
I didn't understand it after all, so tomorrow I'll be thinking about "what the heck is fuga? I have a feeling this will probably be a car... 2021 05/23
Finally changed the file name of the main program to "code-of-python"! 2021 05/29
I squashed a bug that was causing an out-of-index error when I erased a window in the middle of a window that was trying to get the index value of the foremost window based on the ID of the active window, but the index value was out of sync! (It took me 2 weeks to reproduce this bug by messing up the pad...) If you think about it, when you kill an enemy, you get an error like "DEL and index does not exist! I made the same mistake... History repeats itself... 2021 05/29
Name Entry (Maybe it's not necessary? I'm wondering how to display the difficulty level... 2021 05/29
In the DEFFICULTY selection menu, the window now jumps away in various directions after selection. 2021 06/07
In the CONFIG screen, a new item for switching between full-screen and windowed startup is implemented -> I want to switch between full-screen and windowed display on the fly if possible (is it possible?), though it can only be switched by restarting the system. 2021 06/07
It is now possible to turn on/off the boss mode, hitbox display, and debug status display on the CONFIG screen. 2021 06/07
When exiting from the CONFIG screen, the system data is saved and the resources of the title screen are reloaded so that the system data can be reflected immediately. 2021 06/07
The closing process of each window is implemented. 2021 06/11
When adjusting a value with the left/right keys in the CONFIGir menu window, left/right arrows are displayed to indicate whether the current value is the maximum value or the minimum value? It is now possible to know whether the current value is the maximum, minimum, or middle value. 2021 06/13
The volume of the main BGM can be changed in CONFIG (I'm not sure about the SE one, so I'm not going to do it! I don't understand pyxel sound!) 2021 06/19
Graphic data related display in the window view, and animation is now possible. 2021 06/20
I think the phenomenon that the power capsule doesn't come out when an enemy is defeated sometimes is related to the hit detection between the claw shot and the enemy. → I think the indentation is wrong in the loop part of the claw shot and enemy hit judgment function, so the instruction that should be processed was not processed.
It seems that sometimes the power capsule does not appear when an enemy is defeated? Maybe it doesn't appear when you defeat an enemy (only formation group?) with a subweapon? I'm not getting a power capsule when I kill an enemy (only formation group?) with a subweapon?
